Re-generating the figures
=========================

The `tikz` files are bare and have no infrastructure around them.  They were
generated by a program called `tikzit` and exist here simply so that they are
easier to re-generate if needed.  They are not expected to change much.

The easiest way to regenerate them is to use the `tikzit` program.  If using
`tikzit` is not an option then it is possible to build infrastructure yourself
to regenerate the figures.

## Regenerating by hand

You will need `pdflatex`, `pdf2svg`, and
[this](https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/blob/v2.1.6/tex/sample/tikzit.sty)
`tikzit` style file.

Create a basic LaTeX document:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{tikzit}
    \tikzstyle{every picture}=[tikzfig]
    \usepackage[graphics,active,tightpage]{preview}
    \PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}
    \input{mfma.tikzstyles}
    \begin{document}
    \input{file.tikz}  % Replace file.tikz with the file you want
    \end{document}

Then compile and convert to `svg` like so:

    $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error file.tex
    $ pdf2svg file.pdf file.svg
